				Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia
				and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in
				Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
				ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it
				with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which
				roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.Even the all-powerful
				Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost
				unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
				name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. When
				she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
				back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of
				Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful
				a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.
