		description: `About 13.8 billion years ago, there was a Big Bang that gave birth to this universe, or so many of the astronomers believe. But was this explosion a sound or…noise? This question won't even arise until the year 1933, when the doctor of philosophy and medicine, Paul Lueg, first submitted a patent application describing the principles of active noise cancellation. But, it wasn't until 1978 when Doctor Amar Bose, being at his wit's end due to the loud plane engine, decided to do something about it. It is rightly said,
        <br/>
        ...every adversity — contains within it the seeds of opportunity and growth.<br/>
        Here is where the journey of Active Noise Cancellation audiowear began.<br/><br/>
        <b>The Need for Active Noise Cancellation</b><br/><br/>
        Before going forward, let's understand the need for Active Noise Cancellation in today's age.<br/>
        Imagine you're at home, watching your favourite movie. Suddenly, the pressure cooker goes off. The whistling pierces through your ears and makes you miss that one moment you had been waiting for. Yes, we can feel the second-hand frustration.
        Your brain instantly triggers this one thought: Man! Is there no way I can cancel this noise?<br/>
        During travel, at home and even at the workplace— wherever you want to focus, Active Noise Cancellation works like a charm. And the reason why Active Noise Cancellation has become such a rage is simple. We now want to choose what we listen to & not settle with unwanted background noise. Now, buckle up boAtheads! We are about to dive into the mechanics of noise cancellation!<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>How Does Active Noise Cancellation Work?</b><br/>
        <br/>
        So, in the land of Audiophilia, the school of warriors prepared themselves for the ultimate fight. They were trained to defeat the greatest enemy: Noise. Now Noise had agents too, known as Decibels. Noise & Decibels enjoyed being a menace. But this cycle was soon to be broken. A new warrior, named ANC, took it on himself to teach Noise & Decibels a lesson. ANC had a superpower. It was to create an army of reverse decibels. Now, these reverse decibels went on a hunt & as reverse decibels collided with decibels, they both were instantly destroyed!?`,

		description: `Most of us are tethered to our devices for at least some part of the day, listening to music, gaming, watching videos on tablet, phones or laptops. Our headphones are not merely an accessory anymore - they are practically an extension of ourselves. Want to stay tuned to your favorite beats or want to indulge in a movie marathon without disturbing the ones around you - the right pair of earphones will allow you to do all of this and a lot more!
But how to find the 'right' ones?
		<br/>
Is that a question which is bothering you as well? Well, the sheer amount of earphones online choices in type, shape, and size can really be confusing! On top of that, there are a lot of factors that matter while choosing your headphones that you might not be aware of.
		<br/>
There's only one way to navigate through all this, that is to learn about the specifics and understand the jargon. You're probably already aware of these and if you're not, keep reading.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>A. In-ear Design</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
You might know them by various names like earbuds, in-ear headphones, these are the smallest and most portable type of earphones. They rest in the bowl of the ear, outside the ear canal, though a portion might extend into the canal. They have foam or rubber tips to give you comfort.
		<br/>
Some models, particularly sports centric ones, come equipped with wings or fins for a tailored and secure fit. These insert-style models when inserted into the canals often form a seal that can help keep out the extraneous noise. They are extremely popular these days due to their stylish looks and convenience.
		<br/>
Talking about the benefits of this design - the first thing that comes to the mind is their small size and hence the portability they offer. You can stuff them in your pockets or carry them in your palm. They don't mess up your hair or interfere with your glasses or earrings! You can carry them effortlessly and always be at your stylish best!
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>B. Ear Clip Design</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
If you are looking for a middle ground between huge and bulky headphones and extremely compact and portable earbuds, then ear-clip design earphones are meant for you. In a lot of ways they carry the best of both.
		<br/>
These headphones are compact and have ear-loops to keep them in place. Mind you they are not like having ear tips, but a complete feature hook that fits over the ears and connects to your music device via Bluetooth or audio jack. This makes them easier to carry around than heavy headphones and more comfortable than earbuds.
		<br/>
On-ear clip-on headphones bestow protection to the user from different kinds of gory bacteria that might enter the ear canal and lead to infections.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>C. Behind the Neck Design</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
We are sure you have already seen people wearing these high-tech collars with headphones sprouting out the sides. They go around with different names like - neckband headphones, collar headphones or even behind the neck headphones.
		<br/>
This distinctive style of design offers them multiple advantages. The first major advantage is quite an obvious one, but still worth pointing out - they are always around whenever you want them. Given that the earbuds are hanging around your neck, mere inches away from your ears, you won't have to dig through your bag or pockets when you want to listen to your favorite tune or take a call.
		<br/>
Apart from this, they also come with many surprises like convenient controls, better mics that are nearer to the mouth, and bigger batteries. In the end, they say I am on the go or I am active and add that extra edge to your personality - Neckbands vs TWS: What Do You Need?`,

That's why we've developed a short test that tells you in a minute which Teufel headphone model could suit you best.
		<br/>
To make sure you can distinguish between in-ear, on-ear and over-ear headphones, we have summarised the most important features of the different designs for you.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>In-ear earphones - your music just for you</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
In-ear headphones are worn in the ear and their compact size makes them the ideal companion for every day. Thanks to advanced technology, our high-quality in-ear headphones offer a particularly pure sound image, with the sound being perfectly audible even at low volumes. The design, which was developed in Berlin, ensures that the in-ear headphones sit securely in the ear, even when you move quickly, and are easy to clean so that you can enjoy them for as long as possible. Among the in-ear headphones are the AIRY TRUE WIRELESS, the MOVE BT or AIRY SPORTS.
		<br/>
		<br/>
        <b>On-ear headphones: - Lightweight, sound heavy</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
Of course, we also have various on-ear headphones in our range. These headphones sit on the ear and do not cover it completely. Comfortable wearing due to the padded ear cups and a slight sound absorption from the outside make these models to all-rounders for every occasion. Thanks to Bluetooth technology, music can be listened to on the move or at home, with or without cables. Popular models are the SUPREME ON or the AIRY.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>Over-ear headphones - maximal sound</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
Over-ear earphones  sit completely on the ear and enclose it completely. This creates a rich sound and better external sound insulation. Over-ear headphones fall into two categories: open and closed. A mixed form is the half-open design. Coveted Teufel over-ear headphones include the REAL BLUE, the REAL BLUE NC, the REAL PURE, the Teufel MASSIVE and the MUTE BT.`,

		description: `Really, it all started to change on July 1st 1979. Before then, headphones were for professionals. Perhaps they were worn to to hear colleagues above the drone of aircraft engines, perhaps to listen to the sound occuring on the stage as the performance is being filmed, perhaps as part of the equipment needed to operate a telephone exchange.
		<br/>
		<br/>
But when Sony's first Walkman launched in Japan in July 1979, and in every other major market by June 1980, headphones began to live a whole other life. They began to be seen in public - and on buses and trains, on pavements and in supermarkets, people suddenly and unselfconsciously started wearing headphones. The concept of the 'personal stereo' proved nigh-on irresistible - and now, more than four decades on, the market for headphones is enormous. And consequently the variety of headphones, in terms of price and configuration and specification, is enormous too.
		<br/>
		<br/>
Like any other technology that's gained traction over decades, headphones today are almost immeasurably better now than then. You may remember those original Walkman headphones, or you may be too young - but either way, if you ever encounter those scratchy, itchy synthetic earpads you won't easily forget them. Neither would the memory (or the scars) of the unpadded, thin, sharp metal-and-plastic headband fade all that quickly. They were an utterly functional item, and little-to-no thought was paid to longevity or comfort, let alone pride of ownership. But they were, almost inadvertently, a status symbol.
		<br/>
		<br/>
The next big game-changer arrived on October 23rd 2001. Apple's iPod wasn't the first portable digital audio player by any stretch of the imagination - the first portable MP3 player is reckoned to be Saehan Information Systems' MPMan of 1998 (though strictly speaking the first digital audio player was Sony's Discman portable compact disc player from 1984). But not for the first time and certainly not for the last, Apple managed to take an existing idea and make it more usable, more covetable, more cool. And so for quite a while, a pair of those unyieldingly uncomfortable ice-white earbuds that came with every iPod was both a symbol of status and the most obvious of come-ons to muggers. Their sound, like that of the first iPod itself, was (at best) blandly unremarkable. But in this instance, that was hardly the point.
		<br/>
		<br/>
Fast-forward two decades and your choice of headphones is almost intimidatingly wide. Audio companies with huge product portfolios and global reputations will sell you disposable in-ear headphones for less than a tenner a pair. Brands more readily associated with the sort of high-ticket luxury accessories you see advertised in high-ticket luxury magazines will relieve you of comfortably more than a thousand pounds for a pair of their over-ear headphones. And in between, what seems like the world and his wife has thrown their hat into the ring, all desperate to grab just a little slice of a market that was estimated to be worth over £18 billion in 2019 and that is growing all the time.`,

		description: `There are endless wireless earphone options in the market. However, not all of them are good. That is why we bring to you the 15 essential aspects you can use to judge wireless earphones' performance.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>Connection</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
All good Bluetooth headsets will provide you a stable connection within 10 meters or more. While judging the quality, you can connect the phone and stand 10 meters away from the phone. If the signal keeps interrupting, it means the quality of wireless earphones is poor.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>Volume Uniformity</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
The volume of both sides of the wireless earphone should be the same. If the right and left earbuds have a different sound quality or volume level, it means the performance of the earphones is poor.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>Sound Quality</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
Good quality wireless earphones don't have murmurs or current sounds. And they can provide the music texture you want.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>Call Quality</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
Call quality has two important things: the sound of the person on the other side and your microphone. You should be clearly audible to the other person on the other end of the call. You should also be able to hear their voice clearly. That is why you should always check the call quality of the wireless earphones by placing a call.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>Battery Life</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
Good quality wireless earphones will work for at least three to four hours after being fully charged. Besides that, the charging chamber should also easily charge your wireless earphones at least three to four times. Battery life is important to ensure your earphones provide you with the most use.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>Battery Standby Time</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
The battery standby time should be at least three to five days. All high-quality wireless earphones provide this standby time. However, you will only get to know if this true after purchasing the earphones. That is why reading the reviews is essential before making your decision.
		<br/>
		<br/>
<b>Device Compatibility</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
Since wireless earphones work on Bluetooth, they should be compatible with all devices. That means your earphones should be compatible with Android, iOS, tablets, PCs, and much more. Such compatibility is essential because you need a solution for all your devices. A wireless headphone that doesn't work on all these devices is not of much use.`,
